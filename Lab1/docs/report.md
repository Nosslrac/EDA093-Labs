Have you met all specifications outlined? ...

In which order? The first functionalities of the shell to be implimented were Ctrl-D handling, basic commands (which was extended to handle I/O, piping etc.) and implementing cd and exit. To check for Ctrl-D from user, check for EOF signal and simply end process using SIGHUP signal. For cd and exit, two helper functions were created to check if "cd ..." or "exit" is received from user. When receiving input from user, and it is not EOF, check for exit command (exit also terminates running child processes). If there is none, then check if command includes cd (execute command and change directory). If the command is neither, continue process to handle the user input. Before the process handles basic commands, it forks and makes the new child execute the command. The new process checks if the command is either read or write for a file. If so, the process handles these using open(), dup2() and STDOUT_FILENO/STDIN_FILENO. For commands that do not interact with other files directly the process starts piping. This is also were background execution was implemented. If the process is the parent and the command executed by the child is a foreground process, then wait for the process to terminate before continuing.

What challenges did you encounter for each specification? One of the biggest challenges was to simply understand and make use of functions, signals, inputs etc. from different used code libraries. These are what makes this lab possible, but it can sometimes be a bit of trail and error when trying to find a good solution to a problem
