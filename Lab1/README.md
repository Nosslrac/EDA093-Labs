# Overview

- `./docs` contains all relevant documentation to this lab:
   - [README.md](./docs/README.md): This is where you will find the lab specifications along with some manual tests that verify if the specifications have been met.
   - [report.md](./docs/report.md): This empty document is where you should write your lab report.

- `./code` features a basic shell skeleton in the file [lsh.c](./code/lsh.c).

   These automated tests complement the set of manual tests found in [README.md](./docs/README.md).

   whenever the repository is updated
